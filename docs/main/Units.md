## Peasants

Peasants work the land and [generate income](../main/Economy.md) for your province. They are the source of all drafted soldiers, thieves, and wizards.

## Soldiers

The basic unit for every province. Drafted from peasants and can be trained into Specialists, Elites or Thieves. No wages required for soldiers.

## Offensive Specialists

Used to attack only — cannot defend.

## Defensive Specialists

Defend your land only — cannot attack.

## Elites

Have both offensive and defensive strength. Values vary by race — see the [Race](../main/Race.md) page.

## Generals

Provinces have 5 generals. One must always stay home to lead the defense; the others may be sent to combat.

- Each additional general sent adds **+3% Offensive Military Efficiency**
- At least 1 general must be sent on any attack
- Sending more than 1 general has no effect on an Ambush

## Wizards

Required to cast spells. Do not count toward military size. See the [Mystics Guide](../guide/Mystics.md) and [Magic Formulas](../guide/Magic_Formulas.md).

## Thieves

Conduct [thievery operations](../misc/Thievery.md). See also [Thievery](../misc/Thievery.md) for formulas.

## Horses

Sending horses adds raw offensive power. You may include up to **one horse per military unit** sent in combat.

## Prisoners

Taken from enemies that would have been killed after an attack (roughly 2/3 of kills), provided there is room in your dungeons. 

- No upkeep; every 2 prisoners fills 1 job and produces 0.75gc/hour
- About one third of prisoners sent in combat are lost in the fight
- You can send at most **1 prisoner per 5† normal troops**

## Mercenaries

Hired fighters available for combat.

- You can send at most **1 mercenary per 5† normal troops**
