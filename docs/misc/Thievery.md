# Thievery

No one ever said leadership involves only public activities. With a state-sanctioned paramilitary thieves guild available to you, the possibilities are endless. What may not be possible through [war](../guide/Relations.md) or [magic](../guide/Mystics.md) may still be possible with deceit and deception. Never underestimate the power of the underground unknown.

Thieves are professional soldiers, trained in the arts of the elite underground and are trained on your [Military](../guide/Military.md) Menu. They maintain a Stealth Rating which determines when they can be used. This rating rises automatically each day by 3 points and drops each time your thieves conduct an operation. Your thieves will not carry out missions without at least a 5% Stealth Rating.

The best measure of your guild's strength is the number of thieves you maintain per acre of land, often known as Thieves Per Acre (TPA), modified by your Thieves' Dens, your Crime science and your [racial](../main/Race.md) bonuses or penalties. The success rate of your guild depends on both your and your target's TPA. The raw damage, however, is based on raw strength - the more thieves you use in an operation, the more damage they can do.

The larger your province, the more difficult it will be to keep your guild well-organized and efficient. As your province grows larger, be prepared to keep training additional thieves to keep your network intact and effective. Like most things in Utopia, thievery operations are easier and more effective against provinces similar to you in size.

Thievery operations are divided in two categories:

- [Espionage Operations](#the-thieves-toolbox-the-espionage-operations)
- [Sabotage Operations](#the-thieves-toolbox-the-sabotage-operations)

## Modified TPA

The success of each operation depends on the two provinces' relative modified TPA, as well as other thief defences like the spell Clear Sight and Watchtowers.

Your TPA can be affected by your race, personality, buildings, science, rituals, and dragons:

```
Modified TPA = Raw TPA × Invisibility × Crime Science × Racial Mod × Thieves Dens Bonus × Honor Bonus × Ritual Bonus
```

| Modifier | Value |
|---|---|
| Invisibility (spell) | 1.1 |
| Ritual: Havoc | 1.2 |
| Crime Science | varies |

### Calculating WPA

No intel operation directly reveals an enemy's wizard count, but wizards contribute to networth. With a full set of intel ops you can back-calculate WPA. Run all four of the following on the same Utopian day (ideally back-to-back, since ops or attacks between them can skew results):

- Spy on Throne
- Infiltrate
- Spy on Sciences
- Survey

Spy on Military is not needed — it only shows troop positions, not totals. Once you have consistent data, the remaining networth unexplained by land, troops, thieves, science, and buildings belongs to wizards.

## The Thieves' Toolbox: The Sabotage Operations

Listed here is a short reference guide to each of the offensive operations available to you and their effects. As mentioned previously, sending more thieves will increase the strength of these operations. Nevertheless, sending too many thieves also increases the chances that the enemy catches your men! Certain operations are designated Unfriendly, Hostile or [War](../guide/Relations.md) Only operations -- Because of the destructive nature of these operations, they can be run only against provinces which have at least a certain level of relations with your kingdom. In addition, you will find that many operations are more effective during heightened relations conditions.

### Formulas

**Optimal thieves to send** for an instant sabotage op:

```
Thieves to Send = (Target Resources × Max % of Total) / Gains Per Thief / Racial Mod
```

Target resources can be found with Spy on Throne. Max % of Total and Gains Per Thief are in the individual op entries below.

**Thievery yield** (what you actually receive):

```
Yield = Thieves Sent
      × MIN(Target NW / Self NW, Self NW / Target NW)  [+ War Bonus]
      × Gains Per Thief
      × (1 − Resources Lost)
      × Racial Mod × Personality Mod × Guile × Cunning
      × Target Race Mod × Target Personality Mod
      × Target Illuminate Shadows
      × (1 − Target Watchtowers effect)
      × (1 − Target Shielding)
      × Stance
```

The NW ratio term means gains are penalised when hitting a much larger or smaller target. Resources Lost is the fraction that is destroyed rather than transferred (e.g. 50% for Steal War Horses).

**Duration ops** have a random component, but the minimum, average, and maximum durations all scale with the number of thieves sent. Oversending on Riots reduces duration. Effects like Guile and the Heretic personality do affect duration ops (unlike duration spells).

### Sabotage Wizards

## Stealth Costs

Each operation costs stealth. Stealth regenerates at 3% per day (Rogues receive more). Operations cannot be performed below 5% stealth.

| Operation type | Stealth cost |
|---|---|
| Spy on Throne, Spy on Defense | 1% |
| All other espionage operations | 2% |
| Sabotage (hostile relations or higher) | 2% |
| Sabotage (no special relations) | 3% |

The spell Expose Thieves reduces a province's stealth by 5% of its current stealth before regeneration is added each tick. For example, at 50% stealth, Expose Thieves reduces it to 47.5% (rounded to 48%) before the tick's regeneration is applied.
