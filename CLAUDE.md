Project-specific guidance for editing the Utopia Guide docs.

## Markdown and MkDocs gotchas

- MkDocs uses Python-Markdown, which is stricter than GitHub-flavored
  Markdown in a few places.
- Nested list items should use 4-space indentation per level. Two-space
  indentation may render as a single flat `<ul>` instead of nested
  lists.
- If a nested list still renders poorly, prefer a flatter structure or
  real headings instead of forcing deep nesting.
- Avoid placeholder self-links like `(#)` and self-referential links to
  the current page. Convert them to real links or plain text.
- Prefer real Markdown headings over bold pseudo-headings.
- Prefer real Markdown tables only for genuinely row/column data. If a
  table is just being used for layout, convert it to headings or lists.
- For historical age pages, avoid duplicating the same material in both
  early summary sections and later reference sections. Keep one
  canonical presentation.

## Historical age docs

- Use the more modern reference-style layout for `Races` and
  `Personalities` when feasible.
- Typical race subsections: `Bonuses`, `Penalties`, `Spell Book`,
  `Operation Access`, `Special Access`, `Units`.
- Typical personality subsections: `Bonuses`, `Spell Book`,
  `Starting Bonuses`, and other clearly named access sections where
  needed.
- Keep `Rituals` and `Dragons` near each other when both are present.
- If a `Rituals` section merely points to content elsewhere on the same
  page, remove the duplicate stub instead of keeping both.
- Use bullet summaries instead of wide one-row tables for stances,
  relations, dragons, and similar dense summaries when the table is hard
  to read on narrow screens.
