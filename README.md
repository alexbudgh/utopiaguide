# Utopia Guide

A community-maintained guide for [Utopia](https://utopia-game.com), built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosted at [utopiaguide.chaos-intel.com](https://utopiaguide.chaos-intel.com).

**Pull requests are welcome!** All content lives in `docs/` as plain Markdown — edit pages directly and open a PR.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo and clone it
2. Install dependencies: `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Preview locally: `.venv/bin/mkdocs serve` → <http://localhost:8000>
4. Edit pages in `docs/`, then open a pull request

## Seeding from the original wiki

The original wiki at `wiki.utopia-game.com` is currently inaccessible (expired SSL). The included scraper pulls archived snapshots from the Wayback Machine and converts them to Markdown.

```bash
./scrape_wiki.py        # initial scrape
./rescrape_broken.py    # re-fetch pages that came out garbled
./fix_links.py          # fix internal links after scraping
```

Already-downloaded pages are skipped, so the scraper is safe to re-run if interrupted.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

### 1. Configure your subdomain

- In `mkdocs.yml`: set `site_url` to your subdomain
- In `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: set the `cname:` field to match
- Add a DNS CNAME record pointing your subdomain to `<your-github-username>.github.io`

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

In your repo settings → Pages → Source: **Deploy from a branch** → branch: `gh-pages` / root.

### 3. Push to master

The GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys automatically on every push to `master`.

## Structure

The site navigation is defined in `mkdocs.yml`, and the published content currently lives under these sections:

```text
docs/
├── index.md              # Home page
├── main/                 # Core game reference and mechanics
├── guide/                # Guides, strategy, and player how-tos
├── history/              # Ages, Genesis, World of Legends, historical data
├── misc/                 # Mechanics, community pages, and miscellany
├── formulas/             # Formula reference pages
├── tools/                # External tool documentation
├── alliances/            # Alliance pages
├── kingdoms/             # Kingdom pages
├── players/              # Player profile pages
├── stylesheets/          # Custom CSS (extra.css)
└── CNAME                 # Custom domain for GitHub Pages
```

Current MkDocs nav groupings:

- `Game Reference`: mostly `docs/main/`
- `Guides` and `Player Guides`: `docs/guide/`
- `Mechanics`: content split across `docs/main/`, `docs/misc/`, and `docs/formulas/`
- `History`: mostly `docs/history/` with some historical pages in `docs/misc/`
- `Community & Tools`: content from `docs/tools/`, `docs/misc/`, `docs/players/`, `docs/alliances/`, and `docs/kingdoms/`
- `About`: informational pages in `docs/misc/`
